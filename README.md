# Crystals Collector

by Brian Peace

//Project Description//

A game where a wizard requires mana to cast his spell. Each crystal adds a specific
amount to his total mana, generating different amounts each time a new spell is started.
The player taps into crystals to generate the exact amount of mana to cast the spell. If
too little is generated, he can not cast the spell. If too much is generated, it will blow up.
